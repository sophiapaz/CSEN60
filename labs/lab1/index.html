            <h2>The Rise of JavaScript Frameworks</h2>

            <p>JavaScript frameworks like React, Angular, and Vue have become essential tools 
            for web developers. These frameworks help developers build interactive, dynamic 
            websites faster and more efficiently. </p>
            
            <p>JavaScript frameworks offer a variety of benefits, including component-based 
            architectures, easier state management, and a growing ecosystem of libraries

            <p> As the web becomes more integral to daily life, web accessibility is more important 
            than ever. Developers must ensure that websites are usable by people of all abilities.</p>

            <p> There are many guidelines and tools available to help developers create accessible 
            websites, including using semantic HTML, providing alt text for images, and ensuring 
            keyboard navigation works smoothly.</p>

            web performance includes techniques like minimizing file sizes, using lazy loading, 
            and leveraging modern image formats like WebP.</p>

            <p> A faster website not only improves user satisfaction but also boosts conversion rates
