# UX/UI Design Lecture

## Notes
### What is Usability
- Usability: measure of how effectively a person can 
    - navigate an interface, find information, achieve specific goals
- Studying and improving usability is part of Human-Computer Interaction (HCI)
- Aesthetic designs trends move fast, but usability changed
- UX: User experience
- UI: User interface

### Web Usability Problems
- Long text (cannot be read quickly)
- cluttered or otherwise poor layout
- requires horizontal scrolling
- assumptions of user's screen size
- poorly chosen colors
- poor or missing navigation controls
- too many ads and non-important content on main page

### Design and Principles
- name and logo on every page (left side) 
- provide search if site has more than 100 documents

### Jakob's Law
- User spend most of their time on other sites, so that's where they form their expectations for how a webpage should work
- follow along websites that do similar functions

### Responsive Design
- website should accommodate user's screensize 
- mediaQuery CSS could be used or usability

## Exercise
- Look at bad websites and anaylze their flaws
    - Website one:
    - no contrast between backround and text
    - link images are too small and the same
    - no distinct sections (ex: footer and info look together)
    - everything is relatively the same size

    - searching something in the website: 
    - x-rays images are all different sizes
    - nav bar is yellow and blended in logo
    - no organization of images
