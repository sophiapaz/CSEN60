# Project Presentation Notes

## Etsy
- used css, javascript, and HTML 
- add to cart function, hover, and remove function
- replica looks pretty accurate
- merging and github errors were difficult
- solution to challenges were W3schools, W3Docs, and AI
- Google is your best friend (someone solved it already most likely)

## POPMART
- That is my Group 

## Netflix
- two pages home page and many functionalities 
- box method, css hover effects may be better in some cases than javascript
- javascript logic and hono server were the most difficult
- Overlaying content (position or z-index)
- Demo: page looks amazing and accurate 

## Twitter
- following and profile page (added videos to show functionality)
- used cookies for their website to store the post (great backend practice)
- inner html could be helpful, but risky 
- do not forget defer in javascript tag :D
- Claude AI 
- comments are really important 

## Reddit
